## Environment Configuration

The following environment variables are already configured:

```bash
PAYCREST_API_KEY=3092148e-573e-455b-9433-d11b7a313082
PAYCREST_WEBHOOK_SECRET=aRj9dg2oQTDX_9PxELQlrzxCnVQxjLYHMvLxdLeJ0VY=
```

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Get Production PayCrest Credentials**
   - Sign up for PayCrest sender account at https://paycrest.io
   - Complete KYB (Know Your Business) process
   - Get production API key and webhook secret
   - Update environment variables

2. **Configure PayCrest Dashboard Settings**
   - Set webhook URL to: `https://minisend.xyz/api/paycrest/webhook`
   - Configure fee parameters (feePercent, feeAddress, refundAddress)
   - Set up tokens and networks (USDC on Base)

3. **Test with Real Transactions**
   - Test with small amounts first
   - Verify webhook notifications are received
   - Check M-Pesa delivery to recipients
   - Monitor order status transitions

## API Endpoints Ready

- `POST /api/paycrest/orders` - Create payment orders
- `GET /api/paycrest/orders?orderId=xxx` - Check order status  
- `POST /api/paycrest/webhook` - Handle PayCrest webhooks
- `POST /api/offramp` - Main offramp endpoint (now uses PayCrest)

## Architecture

```
User Flow:
1. Enter amount (USDC)
2. See conversion rate (KSH)
3. Enter PayCrest details (name + phone)
4. PayCrest order created
5. User sends USDC to provided address
6. PayCrest processes payment
7. KSH sent to user's M-Pesa
```

All components are implemented following PayCrest's sender API documentation and your existing branding patterns. The integration is production-ready pending real PayCrest API credentials.
