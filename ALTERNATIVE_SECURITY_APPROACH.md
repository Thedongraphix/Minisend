# ðŸ”’ Alternative Security Approaches (Less Disruptive)

## Current Implementation Risk Assessment
The current API key approach has these risks:
- Frontend API key exposure in client-side code
- Potential breaking changes if key management fails
- Requires environment variable management

## Alternative Approaches (From Security Report)

### Option 1: **DISABLE PUBLIC ENDPOINT** (Recommended by Report)
- Simply disable `/api/paycrest/orders` GET endpoint entirely
- Keep only authenticated user orders via `/api/user/orders`
- Zero breaking changes, maximum security

### Option 2: **SERVER-SIDE REDACTION ONLY**
- Keep endpoint public but redact all sensitive data
- No authentication required
- Minimal disruption to existing functionality

### Option 3: **IP ALLOWLISTING**
- Restrict endpoint to specific IPs (your frontend domain)
- Block external scraping while allowing legitimate use
- No authentication complexity

### Option 4: **RATE LIMITING + REDACTION**
- Heavy rate limiting (5 requests/hour per IP)
- Full data redaction
- Natural deterrent for scrapers

## Recommended: **Hybrid Approach for Production Safety**
